c***description
c
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure
c     cbalance, which is a complex version of balance,
c     num. math. 13, 293-304(1969) by parlett and reinsch.
c     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 315-326(1971).
c
c     this subroutine balances a complex matrix and isolates
c     eigenvalues whenever possible.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of the two-dimensional
c          array parameters, ar and ai, as declared in the calling
c          program dimension statement.  nm is an integer variable.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix a=(ar,ai).  n is an integer
c          variable.  n must be less than or equal to nm.
c
c        ar and ai contain the real and imaginary parts,
c          respectively, of the complex matrix to be balanced.
c          ar and ai are two-dimensional real arrays, dimensioned
c          ar(nm,n) and ai(nm,n).
c
c     on output
c
c        ar and ai contain the real and imaginary parts,
c          respectively, of the balanced matrix.
c
c        low and igh are two integer variables such that ar(i,j)
c          and ai(i,j) are equal to zero if
c           (1) i is greater than j and
c           (2) j=1,...,low-1 or i=igh+1,...,n.
c
c        scale contains information determining the permutations and
c          scaling factors used.  scale is a one-dimensional real array,
c          dimensioned scale(n).
c
c     suppose that the principal submatrix in rows low through igh
c     has been balanced, that p(j) denotes the index interchanged
c     with j during the permutation step, and that the elements
c     of the diagonal matrix used are denoted by d(i,j).  then
c        scale(j) = p(j),    for j = 1,...,low-1
c                 = d(j,j)       j = low,...,igh
c                 = p(j)         j = igh+1,...,n.
c     the order in which the interchanges are made is n to igh+1,
c     then 1 to low-1.
c
c     note that 1 is returned for igh if igh is zero formally.
c
c     the algol procedure exc contained in cbalance appears in
c     cbal  in line.  (note that the algol roles of identifiers
c     k,l have been reversed.)
